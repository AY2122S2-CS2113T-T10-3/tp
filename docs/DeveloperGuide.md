# Developer Guide

## Acknowledgements

- Some foundational source code was adapted from [addressbook-level2](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2).
- Google's [GSON library](https://github.com/google/gson) was used to facilitate serialisation and deserialisation of data stored in the data file.

## Design & Implementation
### Architecture
Given below is a quick overview of the main components of Mod Happy and how they interact with one another.

### Parser Component

### Data Component

The data component is responsible for the storage and manipulation of tasks and modules, as well as their associated attributes.

The following partial class diagram illustrates the general organisation of this component.

The `ModuleList` class serves as the main data storage class for the program, and is always instantiated when the program is started. It holds:
* A `Module` object representing the General Tasks list. This `Module` is instantiated upon `ModuleList`'s creation and is meant to be the "default" module for all uncategorised or miscellaneous tasks.
* An `ArrayList` containing all user-created modules.

The `Module` class serves as a wrapper around a `TaskList`, providing additional attributes including the module code and module description. Within the context of Mod Happy, modules can be viewed as task categories with names, descriptions and other attributes. For this reason, the General Tasks list is implemented as a `Module` under the hood.

list is simply represented as a `TaskList` instead of a full-fledged `Module`.

> While this model is arguably closer to real life, the program logic would have to operate on different object types depending on whether a given `Task` belongs to a user-created Module or the default General Tasks list. This was deemed to increase coupling and introduce too much unnecessary clutter to the code, hence it was not used.

### Command Component

The command Component is charge of executing the user-intended operation after receiving information from Parser on the user's input.  

All commands inherit the abstract `Command` class, with an `execute` method that returns the result of command execution as a string. 

Commands can be classified into two broad categories:
- Commands that accepts user arguments (e.g. `DeleteCommand`)
- Commands that do not accept arguments (e.g. `ExitCommand`)

Each command has their respective `Parser` classes that call the matching command constructors. (`ListCommand` has `ListParser`)

Here is a simplified class diagram illustrating two example commands:

#### How it works
The type of action that a command executes is dependent on which constructor is called and values passed to it by the respective parser.

## Implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Tag Feature

The tag command accepts a string from the user and adds it into `ArrayList<String> tags` of a `Task`.  

Here is an example on adding a tag to a general task:  
1) User inputs `tag add 2 "testTag"`. 
2) `TagParser` will initialise `TagCommand` with add as `tagOperation` 2 as `taskIndex` and testTag as `tagDescription`, while `taskModule` is null.
3) `TagCommand` then gets the relevant `Module`. If `taskModule` is null, `getGeneralTasks()` is called. Else, `getModule(taskModule)` is called instead.
4) Next, `TagCommand` checks the `tagOperation`. If add, `addTag(targetModule)` is called. Else if del, `removeTag(targetModule)` is called. Else, it throws `ParseException`.

Below is the sequence diagram of how the tag feature works:
