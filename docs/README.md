# Mod Happy

As part of the deliverables for CS2113T, our team was required to develop a command-line interface (CLI) application. 

The team conceptualised Mod Happy as a productivity tool specially adapted for NUS students. 
Mod Happy aims to help students stay on top of homework and other tasks by providing them with an interface to keep track of module deliverables, meetings and deadlines, homework grades and more.
